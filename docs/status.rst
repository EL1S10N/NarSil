========================
Temporary Status Effects
========================

At certain times you may find yourself suffering from various effects. Many of these are displayed in coloured text near the bottom of the map. These will usually wear off in time, and there is typically some kind of consumable item to be found which will immediately remove the effect.

Hunger
------
* Gorged:

  - ≥ 8,000 turns of food
  - You are so full that you cannot eat or drink any more until you recover
  - You digest food much faster in this state.

* Full:

  - ≥ 5,000 turns of food

* Hungry:
  - ≥ 2,000 turns of food

* Weak:

  - ≥ 1,000 turns of food
  - You are at –1 to Strength until you manage to eat enough food to recover

* Starving:
  
  - 0 turns of food
  - You take a point of damage each turn and no longer regenerate health

Other negative effects
----------------------
Blind
  You cannot see anything.
  Note that Melee, Evasion, and Archery are halved against foes you cannot see.

Hallucinating
  Enemies and objects look like other enemies or objects.
  You occasionally see things that are not there.

Slow
  You are moving at half your normal speed.
  May be caused by carrying more weight than your weight allowance (in which case the only way to stop it is to reduce your load).

Confused
  You are unable to choose directions normally for moving, attacking, etc. Attempting to choose a direction may randomly choose a nearby direction instead.

Afraid
  You are too afraid to attack, either by melee, archery, or throwing.

Entranced
  You are frozen in place, cannot act, and are at [-5] evasion.
  This is broken the first time an enemy attacks you (or when enough time passes).

Stunned
  (1 to 50 turns on the stun counter)
  You get –2 to all of your skills

Heavily Stunned
  (51 to 100 turns on the stun counter)
  You get –4 to all of your skills

Knocked Out
  (101 to 105 turns on the stun counter)
  You are frozen in place, cannot act, and are at [-5] evasion.

Poisoned X
  You have been poisoned and will take X damage over the next few rounds.
  Each round you take 20% of X damage (rounded up) and X is decremented by this amount.

Bleeding X:
  You are bleeding from an open wound.
  Handled like Poisoned X.

Drained stats
-------------
If any of your stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Grace) are drained, they will appear in yellow. This will not heal with time: you must find some item to cure it.

Resistances
-----------
* Elemental resistances are described in the section on the elements.
* Resistance to a status effect grants a very large bonus (+10) to any roll to avoid it.
* Free Action conveys resistance to Slowness and Entrancement, as well as helping you escape from Webs.
* See Invisible grants a +10 bonus to seeing otherwise invisible enemies.

There are various positive status effects which may be granted by pieces of equipment or consumables (in the latter case they are always temporary). These include resistances, increased stats or light radius, speed, etc, which are generally explained elsewhere.

Of special note is Regeneration:

* You regain health at three times the normal rate.
* You also suffer from great hunger, and will grow hungry at three times the normal rate.
