The Dungeon
===========

Deep below Thangorodrim go the pits of Angband, and many and sprawling are the corridors and caverns. It is so vast and lacking in order that having once left an area behind, it is highly unlikely that you could navigate your way back.

Deep, deep within the earth, a thousand feet underground, is the throne room of the black enemy Morgoth. There he holds court with all manner of foul orcs, beasts and demons, and in his black iron crown are those three stolen gems, the Silmarils of Feanor. It is normally the greatest and darkest of his servants who are found in the deep parts of the dungeons.

Staircases
``````````

Linking different areas of the dungeon are many winding staircases (represented by ``>`` or ``<``). These will normally take you to an area 50' deeper or shallower. Sometimes you may find shafts that dive down into the rock, taking you 100' deeper. But the dark power of Morgoth calls all new things in Angband to him, and you will only be able to resist this call for so long: as time goes on, you will be unable to find your way to the shallower levels (your character sheet shows this with the ‘min depth’). Only with a Silmaril in your hand will you be able to return to the surface.

This rule stops you slowly accruing power in the shallow regions — if you want to build up the power to face Morgoth’s throne room in time, you will need to quickly descend to the deeper levels where the risks and rewards are greater.
Also note that if you use many staircases in a short period of time, you are liable to become lost and may unwittingly take a wrong turn or step overbold into a trap.
