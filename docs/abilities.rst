Melee
-----
Power
  * Gives a bonus of +1 damage sides to your melee attacks.
  * But increases the amount needed to score each level of critical hit by 1.

    - e.g. need to hit by 8 + weapon-weight instead of 7 + weapon-weight.

Finesse
  * Lowers the amount needed to score each level of critical hit by 1.

    - e.g. need to hit by 6 + weapon-weight instead of 7 + weapon-weight.

Throwing Mastery
  * Gives a +5 bonus to melee when using throwing attacks.
  * Prevents thrown items from breaking.

Polearm Mastery
  * Gives a +1 bonus to melee when using polearms.
  * Allows you to ‘set’ a polearm to intercept attackers.

    - If you waited last turn (pressed ‘5’ / ‘z’) and any opponent who wasn’t adjacent to you moves into an adjacent position, you get a free attack on them.
    - Note that you don’t get the free attack if you cannot see the opponent or you are confused.

Charge
  * If you attack an opponent after having just moved towards that opponent (so that your move and attack are in the same direction or at most 45° apart), then your attack is calculated as if you had 3 more points of strength and dexterity.
  * The damage bonus is only gained if this is a regular, flanking, or controlled retreat attack.

Follow-Through
  * If you kill an opponent, you get a free ‘follow-through’ attack on another opponent adjacent to you.

    - Note that you don’t get the free attack if you cannot see the opponent or you are confused.
  * The follow-up attack only applies if the killing blow was a regular, flanking, controlled retreat, or follow-through attack (so it can be chained).

Zone of Control
  * If an opponent moves between two squares which are both adjacent to you, you get a free attack.

    - Note that you don’t get the free attack if you cannot see the opponent or you are confused.

Subtlety
  * If you wield a one handed weapon and have nothing in your off-hand, then the amount needed to score each level of critical hit is reduced by 2.

    - Note that hand-and-a-half weapons like Bastard Swords do not count as one handed weapons for these purposes.

Momentum
  * Allows you to apply your strength more effectively with your weapon. Your strength bonus to damage is usually limited by the weapon weight in pounds. With Momentum, this upper limit is doubled.

    - For example a character could get up to 3 bonus damage sides with a 1.5 lb shortsword.
    - This works for melee and thrown weapons.

Rapid Attack
  * You receive two melee attacks instead of one, but they are calculated as if you had 3 fewer points of strength and dexterity.
  * The extra attack is only gained if this is a regular, flanking, or controlled retreat attack.

    - In other cases the single attack doesn’t suffer the above penalties.

Two-weapon Fighting
  * You can wield a weapon in your off-hand instead of a shield.
  * Only one-handed weapons can be placed in your off-hand (no hand-and-a-half weapons).
  * You receive an attack with this weapon which is calculated as if you had 3 fewer points of strength and dexterity.
  * The extra attack is only gained if this is a regular, flanking, or controlled retreat attack.

Knock Back
  * When you hit a monster, you make a skill check to see if you can force them back a square. You roll twice your effective strength with that attack against twice their constitution. Your effective strength includes the modifiers for abilities like Charge or Rapid Attack, it is capped by the weight of your weapon, and then there is a +2 bonus if wielding a weapon with two hands.

    - They are only knocked back if there is an empty square for them to move into.
    - They miss their next turn if they are actually moved back.
    - Opportunist attacks don’t trigger Knock Back

Whirlwind Attack
  * When you attack an enemy in an open area (no walls or rubble adjacent to you), you get a free attack on all other enemies that are adjacent to you.

    - Note that you do get the free attacks even if you cannot see the opponent or you are confused.
  * The extra attacks are only gained if this is a regular, flanking, or controlled retreat attack.
  * Note that all the attacks are treated as whirlwind attacks, so they are incompatible with many other abilities.

Strength
  * You gain a point of Strength.

Archery
-------
Careful Shot
  * Halves the chance of arrows breaking (from 20% to 10%).

Precision
  * Lowers the amount needed to score each level of critical hit by 1.

Point Blank Archery
  * When you provoke attacks of opportunity by firing your bow, the enemy you fired at doesn’t get one.

Crippling Shot
  * If you score a critical hit using archery (and do at least 1 point of net damage), your opponent has to make a Will check against 4 times the level of your critical hit. If they fail, they become slowed for one round for each level of the critical hit.

Flaming Arrows
  * Your arrows do an extra die of damage against enemies that are not fire-resistant, but they always break.

    - Remember that you can turn abilities off when you don’t wish to use them.

Rapid Fire
  * When you fire at an enemy, you fire two arrows instead of one, but the attacks are calculated as if you had 3 fewer points of strength and dexterity.

    - If the first shot kills the enemy and there are no more enemies in that direction, there will be no second shot.
    - Note that if it is your final arrow there will be only one shot and no penalty.

Dexterity
  * You gain a point of Dexterity.

-------
Dodging
  * Gives you a bonus of +3 to evasion if you moved last turn.

    - This is not displayed on the side of the screen, but does happen.

  * Doubles the number of dice of protection granted by your shield against ranged attacks, and also against melee attacks on any turn where you wait (press ‘5’ / ‘z’).

    - Note that you don’t get the free attack if you cannot see the opponent or you are confused.

Heavy Armour Use

    - Note that you don’t get the free attack if you cannot see the opponent or you are confused.

Controlled Retreat
  * Gives you a free attack on an opponent if you move from a square adjacent to it to a square not adjacent to it, but only if you didn’t move on the previous round.

    - You cannot get a flanking attack and a controlled retreat attack on the same turn, controlled retreat simply adds to the eligible opponents.
    - Only works on one opponent each time and gives preference to the one that is targeted (if any).

  * The bonus is not applied if you are doing a charge attack.

Cruel Blow
  * If you score a critical hit in melee (and do at least 1 point of net damage), your opponent has to make a Will check against 4 times the level of your critical hit. If they fail, they become confused with pain for one round for each level of the critical hit.

Opportunist
  * If an opponent moves from a square which is adjacent to you to one which is not, you get a free attack.
